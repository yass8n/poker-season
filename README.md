# poker-season

This is a python project that keeps track of poker league standings. After each poker game you will need to input the placements then the application will conveniently show you the new rankings in an easy to follow format. 

The application is written using the [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework. 

I built this application because I was getting tired of manually inputting the data into [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vh8fERVPAjj6y-kj2SFlZOX3nG0YDcu7txqQmDU_SBM/edit) google doc, so figured it makes sense to automate some of this logic and learn a new framework along the way :)
